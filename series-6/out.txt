Once upon a time in China, some believe, around the year one
double-ought three, head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai
Mei was walking down the road, contemplating whatever it  is
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite power contemplates -  which
is another way of saying "who knows" - when a  Shaolin  monk
appeared, traveling in the opposite direction. As  the  monk
and the priest crossed paths,  Pai  Mei,  in  a  practically
unfathomable  display  of  generosity,  gave  the  monk  the
slightest of nods. The nod was not returned.
